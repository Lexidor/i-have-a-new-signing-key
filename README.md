I have a new signing key

Just check github for green checkmarks

[35d6ba9](https://github.com/lexidor/i-have-a-new-signing-key/commit/35d6ba9a6444d55bd74151a98077993ebbf6acf9) doesn't actually sign anything. I used a `-s` on the cli instead of `-S`. Please refer to the next commit [74c1f7f](https://github.com/lexidor/i-have-a-new-signing-key/commit/74c1f7f7db208e5f02e2345d446d863ac96766aa) for the _real_ new signing key.

# I will stop signing my commits

When my current key duration expires (in the second half of February of 2021), I will stop signing my commits.
Any commits signed before this date will suddenly become `Unverified`.
This repository will be removed some time this summer.

The previous message has been signed with my currently active GPG key.

This message has been signed with Github's GPG key.
I will indeed stop signing my commits halfway through February.
